Medical Ophthalmology Application – Application for kids with amblyopia
When I was a child I had vision problems. I had to go to the polyclinic for procedures and, at that time, I felt uncomfortable. 
In the third year of the Institute together with the chief doctor of the ophthalmological department of Chelyabinsk Regional Children’s Hospital Nº 1,
I decided to create a program for children with vision problems.
As planned, this application replaces a signiﬁcantly outdated device and allows children to undergo a range of procedures at home.
The program is currently frozen due to a complex coronavirus situation.
